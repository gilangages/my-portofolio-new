# 🎨 My Portfolio — Full-Stack Web with Admin Panel

A personal portfolio website built with a **Neo-Brutalism / Comic Book** design theme. It features a public-facing showcase and a private admin panel to manage all portfolio content. The project is structured as a **monorepo**, separating the frontend and backend.
